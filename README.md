# Design Acheievements!

MAPS by KNP has the following features, enabling the user ease in navigation.

# Functionalities of our map...

- <b>Night Mode:</b> An alternate colour scheme.
- <b>Help Center:</b> Pop-up display outlining the intricacies and fundamental capabilities of our program.
- <b>Subway Routes & Stations:</b> Additional overlay used to visualize the city's subway lines. Data comes directly from the OSM database API. 
- <b>Search Bar AutoComplete:</b> Allows the user to find their desired results quicker. It also acts as a sort of spell check, allowing the user to know when their input is incorrect, and providing the correct inputs at the same time.
- <b>Directions & Pathfinding:</b> Once the user inputs two different locations, the fastest path is highlighted and directions for travel are provided. 
- <b>Courier Path Travel:</b> This feature is for the courier path travel algorithm, used to optimize travel. 

# Algorithms used for Pathfinding and Courier Path Travel problem:
- Greedy algorithm
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A* search algorithm 

# Is our map USABLE and RESPONSIVE?

<br>During the development of MAPS by KNP, we considered what made an graphical interface usable and speed of our code. Our map contains key aspects from the Seven Princples of GIS usability and Tolerable Waiting times for Web users, with the purpose of enhancing user intercation, usability and responsiveness. </br>
